            for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[29] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club,

        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <img id="imcar" src="Intern2.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the 
            wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like 
            Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik. With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked 
            in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004. Dhoni made his debut in the first match 
            of the series and was run out for a duck. Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against 
            Pakistan. In the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day 
            international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest 
            score by an Indian wicket-keeper. Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in 
            October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur 
            where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls, winning the game for India. 
            The innings would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper 
            and was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. It was also the 
            highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years 
            later by Shane Watson. Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was 
            awarded the Man of the series. <br><br>

            In the DLF Cup 2006-07, Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not 
            qualify for the finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia, 
            though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies and failed to make it to the knock out stage. 
            In the ODI series in South Africa in November 2006, Dhoni scored 139 runs in four matches in the series 
            loss. In the test series that followed, Dhoni scored 114 runs in two tests including a first test 
            victory in South Africa in the first test, but was ruled out of the third test with injury. Dhoni made 
            his T20 international debut in December 2006 against South Africa at Johannesburg. Dhoni was 
            subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC for 2006.<br><br>

            Dhoni led India to victory in the 2016 Asia Cup where India remained unbeaten. Dhoni stepped down as 
            captain of India in January 2017 ahead of the ODI series at home against England. In the second game 
            of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, his tenth century in ODIs and his first in over three years.
             He was named as a wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in which 
             India finished as runners-up. In August 2017, during the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo, 
             he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODIs when he stumped Akila Dananjaya off 
             Yuzvendra Chahal. He reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in ODIs in February 2018, following 
             the stumping of Aiden Markram in the third ODI of the South Africa tour.

            Dhoni returned to Chennai Super Kings for the 2018 season. Dhoni scored 455 runs in the season and led 
            CSK to its third IPL title. Dhoni led CSK to the title again in 2021 and was retained by CSK for ₹12 
            crore (US$1.5 million) before the auction for 2022 season. He stepped down from the captaincy of CSK 
            on 24 March 2022 and Ravindra Jadeja was appointed as the new captain. However, on 30 April 2022, 
            Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni in the middle of the season. Dhoni led the franchise to 
            victory in the 2023 IPL season. Under his captaincy, CSK became the most successful IPL franchise with 
            five title wins and ten final appearances. MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for 
            Super Kings and holds the record for most appearances in the IPL.
