            Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian international cricketer who played in all formats of the game. He is an all-rounder who batted left-handed in the middle order and bowled slow left-arm orthodox . He has won 7 Player of the Series awards in ODI cricket, which is joint 3rd highest by an Indian, shared with former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. He is also the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor Yograj Singh.<br><br>

            Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. In a match against England at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad[4] — a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls, which was a record for fastest half century in International cricket, until it was broken by Dipendra Airee during 2023 Asian Games but Singh still holds the record in the ICC Cricket World Cup and among ICC full member nations. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match. During the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh played eight innings in nine matches and scored 362 runs with a remarkable average of 90.50.[5] He also took 15 wickets in the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of 5.02.<br><br>
            
            In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.[7] In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.

        Yuvraj Singh was born in a Punjabi Sikh family to Yograj Singh, a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh.[12][13] Tennis and roller skating were Yuvraj's favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both. He had also won the National Under-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket.[14] He would take Yuvraj to training every day.<br><br>

        Yuvraj studied at the DAV Public School in Chandigarh. He completed his graduation degree in commerce from DAV College, Panjab University, Chandigarh.[15] He also did two short roles as child star in Mehndi Sagna Di and Putt Sardara.<br><br>
        
        In 2015, Yuvraj got engaged to Hazel Keech and married her on 30 November 2016.[16] In February 2021, he purchased a luxury pent-house in Chattarpur, South Delhi.[17] The couple had their first child, a boy named Orion, on 25 January 2022.[18] Their second child, a girl named Aura, was born on 25 August 2023

        <h3> Early Career</h3>
        <img id="imcar" src="Yearly.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            Yuvraj began his career with Punjab Under-16s at the age of 13 years and 11 months in November of the 1995–96 season against Jammu and Kashmir-16s.[20] In 1996–97, Yuvraj was promoted to Punjab Under-19s and scored 137 not out against Himachal Pradesh Under-19s.<br><br>

            Yuvraj made his first-class debut in late-1997 against Orissa during the 1997–98 Ranji Trophy but was dismissed for a duck opening the innings.[22] His first break-out performance came in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy Final of 1999 against Bihar at Jamshedpur; Bihar was all out with a score of 357 and Yuvraj batted at three for Punjab and made 358 runs himself. Yuvraj represented India in the series against Sri Lanka Under-19s in India in February 1999. In the third ODI, Yuvraj scored 89 runs from 55 balls. In 1999-2000 Ranji Trophy, he scored 149 against Haryana.<br><br>

            In the 2000 Under-19 Cricket World Cup which India won under the captaincy of Mohammad Kaif, Yuvraj's all-round performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and a call-up to the national squad. His performance in the tournament included 68 off 62 and 4/36 against New Zealand in a group stage match, and a quickfire 58 off 25 balls against Australia in the semifinal. Yuvraj was subsequently selected in 2000 for the first intake of cricketers in the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.

        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <img id="imcar" src="Yint.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy on the back of his impressive performances for the Under-19 team. He made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the quarterfinal match against Australia, Yuvraj won the man of the match for his innings of 84 out of 80 balls, against a pace attack consisting of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, that helped India win by 20 runs.[29] In the semifinal against South Africa, he scored 41 and picked 1/15.[30] He scored only 18 against New Zealand in the final which India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from the team.<br><br>

            Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He scored a crucial 98* against Sri Lanka in the fifth match of an otherwise disappointing series with the bat.[31] However, he proved to be useful with the ball as he took 8 wickets at an average of 27.[32] In the Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a duck in the final against South Africa.[33] Following this, Dinesh Mongia and Hemang Badani were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home series against England in January 2002.<br><br>

            Yuvraj returned to domestic cricket in early 2002. After a disappointing run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for North Zone against South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match in March 2002.[34] He was immediately drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe with India trailing the series 1–2. Yuvraj made an impact in his return match at Hyderabad, scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, taking India to a five-wicket win and levelling the series. He won the Man of the Match award for his efforts.[35] In the final ODI at Guwahati, Yuvraj made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101 runs and the series 3–2

        <p id="career_p">
            Yuvraj was the icon player and captain for Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kings XI Punjab in the first two seasons; in 2010, the third season, icon player status was discontinued and the captaincy given to Kumar Sangakkara. The Kings XI Punjab came second in the round-robin phase of the tournament, but lost the semi-finals to the Chennai Super Kings. On 1 May 2009, Yuvraj registered his first hat-trick in T20 cricket against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Kingsmead in Durban, the same ground where he hit his six sixes. He dismissed Robin Uthappa, Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis. On 17 May 2009, Yuvraj took his second Twenty20 hat-trick against Deccan Chargers at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Yuvraj dismissed Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Symonds and Venugopal Rao.<br><br>

            The Pune Warriors were a new team introduced for the 2011 IPL. Yuvraj Singh was bought by the team and chosen as captain.[114] Pune Warriors finished ninth, ahead of only the Delhi Daredevils.[115] From 14 matches, Yuvraj took 11 wickets and also scored 343 runs at an average of 34.30, including two half-centuries.[116] After much controversy, the BCCI allowed Pune Warriors to find a replacement for Yuvraj for the 2012 Indian Premier League, citing his medical condition and non-availability for 2012 IPL as the reasons for doing so.<br><br>

            In 2014, Yuvraj was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for 14 crore.[118][119] A Kingfisher employee union sent a letter to Yuvraj requesting him not to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore. He had a successful stint with RCB, scoring 376 runs and taking six wickets. In 2015, he was bought by Delhi Daredevils for Rs.16 Crores, the highest ever bid at an IPL auction. at the time.<br><br>

            In the 2016 IPL auction he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs.7 crores. He had a very successful IPL campaign with the Sunrisers Hyderabad with them winning the 2016 Indian Premier League. He played several crucial knocks at crunch moments, and some experts called him the "Unsung hero of SRH's titular run". Yuvraj scored 38 runs from 23 balls in the final.<br><br>

            Yuvraj was retained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for the 2017 Indian Premier League.<br><br>

            In the 2018 IPL auction, he was picked by Kings XI Punjab for base price of 2 crores. He scored only 64 runs from 6 innings at a low average of 12.80. He batted at four different positions during those six innings and was not given a consistent run by the team management.<br><br>

            Yuvraj was released by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2019 IPL Auction, where was purchased by Mumbai Indians for his base price of ₹1 crore. He scored 53 in his debut match for Mumbai Indians, and smashed a hattrick of sixes against Yuzvendra Chahal in the next match, but he wasn't given a longer run by the team management, and was dropped after he failed in the next two matches.[123] He was released by the Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2020 IPL auction.
