            Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is an Indian cricketer. A left-handed opening batsman, he 
            captains Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League and plays for Delhi in first-class cricket. At the 
            2013 Champions Trophy and 2017 Champions Trophy, Dhawan was the leading run-scorer and was awarded the 
            'Golden Bat' in both the tournaments. He was the leading run scorer for India at the 2015 Cricket World 
            Cup. He also became the first player in the history of IPL to score two back-to-back centuries. 
            He was awarded the 'Player of the Tournament' for his exploits in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, which 
            he won with his national side. In the 2018 Asia Cup which Dhawan won with his national side, he was 
            named Player Of The Tournament as he was the top scorer of the tournament with the bat.<br><br>

            Dhawan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in October 2010 at Visakhapatnam. 
            His Test debut came against the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali, where he scored the fastest 
            century by any batsman on Test debut and ended his innings with 187 runs from 174 balls.<br><br>
            
            In August 2013, Dhawan recorded the then-second-highest individual score in a List A match when he 
            scored 248 runs off 150 balls for India A against South Africa A at Pretoria. During the 4th ODI
             against South Africa in Johannesburg, he became the first Indian and ninth overall to score a century 
             in his 100th ODI game. On 14 June 2018, against Afghanistan, Dhawan became the sixth batsman, and the 
             first for India, to score a century before lunch on day one of a Test.

He played three games in the tournament averaging 85. Dhawan was subsequently drafted into the Delhi Under-19 team in October 2001, at the age of 15, for the Cooch Behar Trophy. In 2001/02 Vijay Merchant Trophy, Dhawan impressed once again with the bat by scoring 282 runs in 5 innings at an average of 70.50.<br><br>

            In October 2002, Dhawan was selected again in the Delhi Under-19 team for the Cooch Behar Trophy in which he made 388 runs from 8 innings at an average of 55.42 including two centuries. He was then picked to play for North Zone Under-19s in January 2003 in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. Dhawan scored 45 and 12 in the semifinal against Central Zone, before top-scoring for his team with 71 in the final on a seaming track in Rohtak against East Zone securing his team an innings-win. In the CK Nayudu Trophy held in February 2003, Dhawan averaged 55.50 with the bat for North Zone Under-19s.[18] He continued to amass runs at the Under-19 domestic level as he scored 444 runs from 6 innings at an average of 74 in the Cooch Behar Trophy in October[19] after which he was made the captain of the Delhi Under-19 team.

        <p id="career_p">
            The Indian team then went to the West Indies for a triangular series against West Indies and Sri Lanka. Dhawan scored 135 runs in five games at an average of 27. His only half-century in the series came against West Indies at Port of Spain where he made 69 off 77 balls. India won the series by beating Sri Lanka in the final in which he scored 16. In July–August, India toured Zimbabwe for five ODIs, resting several first-choice players, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli. Dhawan scored a total of 209 runs in four matches at an average of 52.25 and finished as the leading run-getter of the series, while India won the series 5–0. In the second match at Harare, he scored his third ODI century. He was awarded the man of the match for his innings of 116 which helped India post 294/8 after being 65/4 in the 17th over.<br><br>

            In August 2013, he played for India A on its tour of South Africa. He continued to be in good form in the triangular series against South Africa A and Australia A. He recorded the second-highest List A innings of all time by scoring 248 runs off 150 balls against South Africa A in the last group match of the series at Pretoria, the winner of which would play Australia A in the final. His innings included 30 fours and seven sixes and helped India A put up 433/3 on board and win the match by 39 runs. After the match, South Africa A captain Justin Ontong described Dhawan's knock as "the best one-day innings" he had ever seen, and added "Every shot he hit found the gap or went over the fielders. It was like watching a highlights package. He hit so many good shots, it's hard to pick out one that stood out. There were a few sixes that went into the construction site." Dhawan then scored 62 in the final against Australia A as India A clinched the series with a 50-run win. He finished as the highest run-getter of the series, scoring 410 runs at an average of 102.50 and a strike rate of over 135.<br><br>

In the ODIs, he scored 284 runs in 6 innings at an average of 56.80 and was involved in three century opening stands with Rohit Sharma. In the second ODI at Jaipur, Dhawan scored 95 off 86 balls to help India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of just one wicket, the second-highest successful run-chase in the history of ODI cricket. In the sixth game at Nagpur, he scored a 102-ball 100, his fourth ODI century, which helped India successfully chase Australia's total of 350. He was dismissed for 60 in the final match at Bangalore which India won to clinch the series. In November 2013, after being unable to convert starts into big knocks in the two-match Test series and the first two ODIs against West Indies, Dhawan scored a match-winning 119 off just 95 balls in the series-deciding third ODI at Kanpur and was named player of the match.
