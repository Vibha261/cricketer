            Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the 
            Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast bowler. He 
            currently represents Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is 
            widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and the best of the 21st 
            century.<br><br>

            He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the 
            fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries 
            in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a 
            member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. In 2013, 
            Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2018, he was ranked top Test 
            batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of 
            the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket

            sports category in 2017 and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna award, in 2018.<br><br>
            
            In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, 
        worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, 
        Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his 
        early education at Vishal Bharti Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity 
        for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request 
        his father to bowl to him.<br><br>

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who'd 
        espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged 
        for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined 
        young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing. Upon 
        the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket 
        academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket. 
        Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, 
        not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to 
        influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals, as he was 
        determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of nepotism 
        and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually 
        found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[11] He received training at the academy while simultaneously 
        participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave. As per Sharma's 
        recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for 
        the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to 
        physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart. In pursuit of 
        furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education. 
        Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he 
        never missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding 
        respect from the local bowlers.<br><br>

        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack. During his 
        childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his 
        father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his 
        father's presence at times. Following the demise of Kohli's father, his mother observed a significant 
        change in his personality. Kohli appeared to become more mature overnight, and he began taking every 
        cricket match seriously. He harboured an aversion to exclusion from games and appeared to channel his 
        entire existence into the pursuit of cricket following his father's untimely demise. Kohli's family 
        resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.

        <h3> Early Career</h3>
        <img id="imcar" src="vC1.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 
            in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the three-match 
            Test series. Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach 
            Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his 
            admiration for profound technical prowess. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. 
            In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. 
            In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded 
            the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore. In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India 
            Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended 
            in a draw with a 1–1 score line. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a 
            tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many 
            opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri 
            Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. 
            However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.<br><br>

            In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 
            2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 
            235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of 
            three cricketers to compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West 
            Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the 
            tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the 
            match award. Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand 
            Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to 
            India's 3-wicket victory. In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South 
            Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).<br><br>
            
            In June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were 
            awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen 
            cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of 
            Excellence in Brisbane. In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was 
            selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, 
            his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a 
            knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's 
            performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing his progress. With 
            twenty-eight under-19 ODIs and twelve under-19 Tests, he embarked on his journey to international 
            cricket by joining the senior team on their flight to Colombo.

        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <img id="imcar" src="vC2.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the 
            Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only 
            eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up". During the 
            Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play 
            due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series. On 18 
            August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where 
            he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara. However, in 
            the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a 
            total of fifty-four runs scored.<br><br>

            Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the 
            injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 
            2008. Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he 
            participated in, scoring 49 runs. In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against 
            Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian 
            bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason 
            Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings 
            and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level 
            international competition.<br><br>

            Kohli got the chance to captain in an ICC tournament for the first time in the 2017 ICC Champions 
            Trophy. In the semi-final against Bangladesh, Kohli scored 96* and became the fastest batsman in terms 
            of innings to reach 8,000 runs in ODIs in 175 innings. India reached the final, but lost to Pakistan 
            by 180 runs. In the third over of Indian innings, Kohli was dropped in the slips for just five runs 
            but caught the next ball by Shadab Khan at point on the bowling of Mohammad Amir. He was also named as 
            part of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy by the ICC.

        <h2> Domestic Career</h2>
        <img id="imcar" src="vC3.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier League (IPL), 
            a franchise-based Twenty20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by 
            Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. 
            This decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.<br><br>

            <b>2010–2012: Rise, retention and realization</b><br><br>
            In the 2010 season of the IPL, Kohli, assuming the role of vice-captain for the Bangalore, 
            was positioned strategically in the middle order, he augmented Bangalore's batting depth and made 
            notable contributions to the team's success. Notably, his contribution was observed during a victory 
            over the Kings XI Punjab, where he played an instrumental role in concluding the match. Furthermore, 
            his cameos in away fixtures against the Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab, forging valuable 
            partnerships, particularly with Kevin Pietersen. Kohli's standout performances came in futile 
            encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored 58 runs at a strike rate of 165. As the season 
            progressed, Kohli's fielding prowess also came to the fore, augmenting his contribution to the team's 
            cause. Upon securing a place in the playoffs, the Bangalore team confronted Mumbai Indians in the 
            semi-final. Bangalore suffered a setback, succumbing to a defeat margin of 35 runs, as Kohli's 
            contribution was limited to a tally of 7 runs in Bangalore's total, thereby ending Bangalore's 
            campaign in the tournament. In the Champions League Twenty20 held in September, the Bangalore team 
            found themselves in an encounter against the Mumbai Indians. In pursuit of a target of 165 runs, 
            Kohli played a steady innings, contributing 47 runs. The match came down to the final ball, which 
            resulted in Kohli's dismissal, leading to Bangalore falling short by a margin of 2 runs. As a 
            consequence, their upcoming game against the Lions became a virtual knockout match. In this must-win 
            encounter, Kohli scored 49* runs, guiding his team to victory and securing a place in the semi-finals. 
            In the semi-final clash against the Chennai Super Kings, Bangalore faced a significant defeat of 52 
            runs(D/L method).<br><br>

            Prior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an amount of 
            US$1.8 million. In the opening match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kohli started his campaign 
            with a score of 23 runs. He registered his first half-century of the season against the Deccan 
            Chargers, in pursuit of what was then the second-highest run chase, however Bangalore fell short by 3
            3 runs. After lacklustre start for Bangalore, winning two out of their first six matches, Kohli scored 
            56 runs in the next match against the Delhi Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for 
            the first time in the tournament. In the subsequent match, he continued his form against the Pune 
            Warriors, where he claimed his second player of the match award. It was during this match that Kohli 
            became the leading run-scorer of the season, donning the Orange cap for the short time, and he also 
            surpassed the milestone of 1000 runs in the IPL. During the mid-tournament, with regular captain 
            Daniel Vettori sustaining an injury, Kohli had the opportunity to captain his side for the first time 
            in an IPL match. Team's coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli for his efforts, acknowledged his potential 
            to become the future captain not only of the franchise but also of the Indian national team. The team 
            ended their league stage campaign on a high note, defeating the Chennai Super Kings and securing the 
            top position on the points table. In the first qualifier, Kohli scored 70 of 44 balls. Setting a 
            target of 175 runs, Bangalore failed to defend, resulting in knockout match against the Mumbai Indians. 
            In the knockout match, Bangalore triumphed over Mumbai, securing their place in the IPL final for the 
            second time. In the final, chasing a target of 205 runs, Kohli contributed 35 runs to the team's total. 
            However, Bangalore once again fell short in their pursuit of the title. During the season, Kohli amassed 
            557 runs, including four half-centuries, and earning the distinction of being the second-highest 
            run-scorer of the season, trailing West-Indian teammate Chris Gayle. In the Champions League, 
            Bangalore encountered a defeat in their first match against the Warriors. In the following match, 
            Kohli got dismissed for a duck, leading to another loss for Bangalore. To secure a spot in the 
            semi-finals, they needed to win their remaining two matches. In their last group-stage match against 
            the Southern Redbacks, Kohli showcased his aggressive batting by scoring 70 runs off just 36 balls, 
            propelling Bangalore into the semi-finals. In the semi-final clash against the New South Wales Blues, 
            Kohli once again played match-winning innings, scoring an unbeaten 84 runs. However, in the final 
            showdown against the Mumbai Indians, Bangalore suffered a defeat by a margin of 31 runs.<br><br>

            <b>2015–2016: Collective and individual success</b><br><br>

            At the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced 
            pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team. Kohli strategically 
            decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers 
            Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign. Continuing his form, Kohli 
            achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the 
            Chennai Super Kings. In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory 
            and ending their three-match losing streak. During this match, he exhibited his tactical acumen by 
            promoting AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's 
            premier batsman face more deliveries. Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in 
            the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli 
            guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase. However, in an away game against Chennai, 
            Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due 
            to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore's loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak. 
            His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, 
            forming a record-breaking 215-run partnership with de Villiers. In a rain-affected match against the 
            Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, 
            earning him player of the match award. In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an 
            incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to 
            breach's absence of severity. Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, 
            Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the 
            league. However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental 
            to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. 
            Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, 
            then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.<br><br>

            In the 2016 season of the IPL, Kohli's campaign began with 75 runs, contributing to a victory of 45 
            runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. He continued his run in the subsequent match, scoring 79 runs. 
            Throughout the early matches, Kohli consistently achieved the milestone of scoring half-centuries in 
            three out of the four matches he played, while sharing three century partnerships with de Villiers. 
            In the encounter against the Gujarat Lions, he registered his first century in Twenty20 cricket. 
            Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli's knock earned him the player of the match. 
            Despite Kohli's performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out 
            of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table. 
            To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next 
            seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising 
            Pune Supergiant as Bangalore's virtual knockouts began. He continued to deliver match-winning 
            performances, forming a record-breaking partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat, 
            followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders. In a rain-affected match against 
            he Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 
            4,000 runs in the league. His batting drew high praise from Harsha Bhogle, who lauded his technical 
            proficiency and shot-making. Kohl's consistent performances propelled Bangalore to the playoffs, as he 
            scored four consecutive fifty-plus scores in must-win matches and finished the league stage with 
            tally of 919 runs. In the playoffs, Bangalore faced Gujarat in the first qualifier. 
            Kohli was dismissed for a duck in that match, however his team emerged victorious, setting up a 
            final against the Hyderabad. Kohli contributed 54 runs in Bangalore's pursuit of target of 209 in the 
            final. Notwithstanding, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, leaving him to acknowledge the 
            Hyderabad team's performance and express his gratitude to the Bangalore crowd for their support. 
            Kohli concluded the season with record 973 runs in 16 matches, at an average of 81.08, establishing 
            himself as the highest run-scorer of the tournament and claiming Orange Cap with the title of Most 
            Valuable Player.
