            Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains 
            the India national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the 
            best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known 
            for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting 
            records which famously includes most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket 
            World Cups (7) and most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is the first player to 
            score 5 T20I centuries.[4] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.<br><br>

            Sharma formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 
            2020 under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record 
            with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 
            World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is 
            one of four players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition 
            in 2007 to the latest one in 2022. <br><br>
            
            Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day 
            International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and 
            also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he 
            won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, 
            the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government 
            of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth 
            time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second 
            overall and first in T20I format.<br><br>
            
            Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino 
            Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). 
            He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs 
            in India.

        Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. His mother, Purnima Sharma, is 
        from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport 
        firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low 
        income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends. 
        He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma. His mother tongue is Telugu.<br><br>

        Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him 
        to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket 
        facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford 
        it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket". 
        Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted 
        him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket 
        tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.

        <img id="imcar" src="Early1.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in 
            March 2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls 
            remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match. It was Sharma's 
            unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in 
            Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight. He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia 
            with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probable's list for the upcoming 
            ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.<br><br>

            Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 
            57 and 22 as India won by 3 wickets. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season 
            and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat. Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring 
            a half-century (57) in his second innings in the final against Bengal.<br><br>
            
            Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his 
            highest career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat. In October 2013, upon the 
            retirement of Ajit Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.

        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <img id="imcar" src="Rint.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden 
            Gardens in Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian 
            to Shikhar Dhawan (187). He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, 
            the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.<br><br>

            Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after he 
            had earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his 
            natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches. Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, 
            scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian victory. During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw 
            him miss the second Test in Perth. He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 
            63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win both the Test and the series. After the third Test, 
            Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter.<br><br>

            In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his 
            first double century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match. Sharma was named as 
            vice-captain of India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.<br><br>

            Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's comeback after a 
            defeat in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed "deserves to be 
            considered one of the greatest this century." He put on 167 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket 
            while making 161 runs in an innings that included 18 fours and two sixes. India went on to win the Test by 
            317 runs.[39] He top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad with 
            scores of 66 and 25 contributing to his team's win.[40] Sharma finished the series aggregating 345 runs, 
            the most for India, at an average of 58.[37] He went on to score his first overseas Test century on 4 
            September 2021 with an innings of 127 against England at The Oval, also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs 
            in Test cricket.

        <img id="imcar" src="Rdom.png">
        <p id="career_p">
            Sharma joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise, 
            based in Hyderabad, for the sum of US$750,000 a year. In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million 
            to the Mumbai Indians. He scored his only IPL century in the 2012 tournament with 109 (not out) against 
            the Kolkata Knight Riders. Under his leadership, Mumbai has won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 
            2020; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.<br><br>

            Sharma has been one of the most successful players in the IPL as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai 
            Indians, who have won the tournament five times under his leadership. He is currently (March 2022) one 
            of six players who have scored 5,000 career runs in the competition. Sharma has 5,611 runs with one 
            century and 40 half centuries and is the third-highest run scorer after Virat Kohli (6,283) and Shikhar 
            Dhawan (5,784)

        <p id="record_p">
            Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international 
            match, with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on November 13, 2014. He is 
            the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket. In 
            January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
             During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single 
            edition of the Cricket World Cup.<br><br>

            On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score 
            two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman. In the same series, 
            he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.<br><br>

            On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against 
            Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most 
            international sixes (553). His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, 
            allowed him to reach this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.<br><br>

            On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to 
            complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format. This feat occurred during a highly anticipated 
            India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 1 lakh enthusiastic fans.[114] 
            The Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant 
            Strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies 
            his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.<br><br>

            On the 22nd of October 2023, during a thrilling encounter against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma, fondly 
            known as the 'Hitman,' etched his name in the annals of cricket history. In a remarkable feat, he 
            became the first Indian batter to smash 50 One Day International (ODI) sixes in a single calendar 
            year. This incredible display of power-hitting is a testament to Rohit's batting prowess and his 
            ability to dominate the limited-overs format. With each mighty swing of his bat, Rohit Sharma continues 
            to redefine the boundaries of achievement and captivate cricket enthusiasts around the world, 
            solidifying his status as one of the most prolific and electrifying batters in the game.<br>
